I am working on last 3+ years with High Volume of data management and analysis. ( 8 TB /   30million/operation). 

Used high performance architecture to resolve low latency and minimum over head memory. 
Multiple caching in DataFrame format for future reuse. 
Data stored in Hadoop or SQL database with DB Overhead. Resolved out of memory and Data skewness over increasing data volume. 

Experienced in multiple CRM Frameworks , SugarCRM, SalesForce , Drupal more than 4 years. I migrated or inserted Data by API or direct database. It is very easy to build automation to insert value. But, validation of inserted data is little tricky. My solution help client to insert and validate CRM data very well, I was able build trust. I also have expertise to extract Big Data from around 2 million small log files from Hadoop Ecosystem / S3 and insert into ElasticSearch Database. I am very much familiar with CRM components like , Account, , Oppoerutuinity , User , User Profile , Teams etc and Automation to build by Rest API.
I have excellent project work on extracting data from multiple sources. Web-scraped through multiple websites (might be looped) and build automation to extract information and build spreadsheet.
