I am uploading all updated sharable projects in this Repository.

I am always trying to build good reputation and trust with Client. It is easily maintain by following some steps : share my availability , Work hours  , graph of incremental progress , estimate graph and daily status. Divide the project in 5 stages ,
 1) Analysis : Based data variety, mapping project requirement and performance on time, Analyse sample and find quality (lack of information). It help to estimate project timeline.  
2) POC : framework compatibility with the project and environment . Take small data and apply algorithm ,
3) Development : Design Architecture and follow to implement Service / Application 
4) Testing : If sample data is not available, generate data and follow the Testing -    Unit,  Integration , Load 
5 ) Handling Feedback : Demo with Client and tune to repeat steps 3 and 4

 Hope my suggestion will help you. Please let me , if you want to discuss more details, I can come up with better solution.
